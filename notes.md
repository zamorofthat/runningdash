another cool idea is if we take the delta between before and after the gel consumption. also i just upped my fueling on my last 3 long runs to every 2 miles + saltsticks instead of stricly lmnt a gel every 2 miles +  2 salt tabs every 3/4 miles 

we may want to convert most of these to logarimithic so they show better
